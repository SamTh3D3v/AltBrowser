	"Create a large array of elements at random."

	"AltTreeTests exampleRandomItems"

	"Notes on that one:
	- Performance analysis on an instance of that example:
		[ self refresh. self fullDrawOn: Display getCanvas ] timeProfile
	- Drawing large fonts is extremely slow in LCD mode for freetype:
		422ms, 331ms in the display, 87ms refreshing the items.
	- Drawing in CRT mode for freetype is a lot faster, but ugly on small glyphs:
		166ms, 110ms refreshing the items, 46ms in the display.
	Would an optimisation on no subpixel for large fonts correct that?"
