An AltBrowser is a complete alternative system browser, message list and finder.

It builds a representation of  the code structure as a abstract tree, out of AltAbstractNode, in the class side. That tree is kept on the class side, and is connected to all the system announcements tracking code changes (loading, creating, compiling, etc...).

Each instance handle the display of the overall tree in a GUI and an environment (a Refactoring Browser environment). The GUI is simply a MorphTreeMorph instance and a PluggableTextMorph, and the context menus for both morphs. The instance reference a display tree based on AltTreeNodeModel which is manipulated by the user interactively and also filtered by the environment associated with the instance (for example restricted to a package / a class / a set of selectors)
