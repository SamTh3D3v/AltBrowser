This command run the related test, if the selected method is apparently a test.

Is active if the selected item class inherits from TestCase. Is enabled if the method start by 'test'.

Does not run the test, but debug it. Is a more convenient way of running the test by hand, and avoid, as it is the case in Nautilus and OmniBrowser, to have two tests runs if it fails (and, in some cases, twice the effect of running the test).
