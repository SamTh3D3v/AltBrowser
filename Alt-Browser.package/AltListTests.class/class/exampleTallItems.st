exampleTallItems
	"Create an array of tall elements at random."

	"Notes on that one:
		Since scrolling is logical in an AltTree, there is a distortion when the row
		are tall, with a specific issue when the row is taller than the view. The
		approach would be to have a kind of translation from pixel scrolling into
		logical (rows) scrolling which depends of the row height."
