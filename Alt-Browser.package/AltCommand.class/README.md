I am in charge of preparing and executing commands.

I can take place in a menu and register as a keymapping tool.

Instance Variables
	requestor:	<Object>	The object sending the command.
	target:		<Object>	The target (where the command is applied).
				
Requestor and target are to be used accordingly to the application; subclass AlTreeCommand for effect.
