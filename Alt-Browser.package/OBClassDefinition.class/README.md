OBClassDefinition presents a textual interface for examining, modifying and creating classes. Given a class, it knows how to display the definition expression that reflects it's current state, and knows how to create or modify a class given a definition expression.

OBClassDefinition implements a number of safety checks when defining or redefining classes, to ensure that existing classes are not accidentally overwritten.
