I contain visible rows in a tree morph

exposed rows are a dictionary index -> morph.

leftOffset is to shift the view to the right (for items too wide for the view).

Two levels of refresh: from the model and from the view / scrollbars. The latter is optimized.

Is designed to handle varying row heights.
