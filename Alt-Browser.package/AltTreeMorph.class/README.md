I'm an implementation of a tree, in an optimised / dedicated way, reusing the fast table approach (only building and displaying the visible rows).

Since I am a tree, what is indexing is dependent on how nodes in the tree are expanded or not.

Everything too tree like (prior morph or whatever) won't exist. From the display point of view, this is a list.

Consider two types of refresh / updates:
- data updates (refresh?)
- display updates and changes
