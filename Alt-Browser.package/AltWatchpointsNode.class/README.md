Gives access to all watchpoints in the current environment.

List of class / method.

Unable to see added watchpoints by other means than myself, since the default watchpoint api doesn't announce anything (including for its own gui :facepalm:).

Maybe I need to add a watchpoint on the watchpoint API?
